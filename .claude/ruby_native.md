# Ruby Native

Turn your Rails app into an iOS app. Any frontend framework. No Xcode required.

## Quick start

1. Add the gem to your Gemfile and bundle:

```ruby
gem "ruby_native"
```

2. Run the install generator:

```bash
rails generate ruby_native:install
```

3. Edit `config/ruby_native.yml` with your app name, colors, and tabs.

4. Add to your layout `<head>`:

```erb
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1,viewport-fit=cover">
<%= stylesheet_link_tag :ruby_native %>
```

The `viewport-fit=cover` attribute is required so CSS `env(safe-area-inset-*)` variables return real values. If you already have a viewport meta tag, add `viewport-fit=cover` to its `content` attribute.

5. Add to your layout `<body>`:

```erb
<%= native_tabs_tag %>
```

6. Start your Rails server and the preview tunnel in separate terminals:

```bash
bin/rails server
```

```bash
bundle exec ruby_native preview
```

Scan the QR code with the Ruby Native Preview app from the App Store. Keep both the server and tunnel running.

## Configuration

`config/ruby_native.yml` controls the native shell. Changes are picked up without restarting the server in development.

```yaml
app:
  name: My App
  entry_path: /inbox  # initial URL on app launch (defaults to first tab's path)

appearance:
  tint_color: "#007AFF"
  background_color: "#FFFFFF"

tabs:
  - title: Home
    path: /
    icon: house
  - title: Profile
    path: /profile
    icon: person
```

Icons use SF Symbols names (e.g., `house`, `person`, `envelope`, `gear`).

### Dark mode

Color fields accept a plain hex string or an object with `light` and `dark` keys:

```yaml
background_color:
  light: "#FFFFFF"
  dark: "#212529"
```

Match these to your CSS framework's dark mode colors. For Bootstrap, `#212529` is `--bs-body-bg` in dark mode.

## View helpers

Use these in your layouts and views:

- `native_app?` returns true when the request comes from a Ruby Native app. Use it to hide web-only UI like navbars.
- `native_tabs_tag` renders a signal element that tells the app to show the tab bar. Only include it on pages where tabs should appear.
- `native_form_tag` marks the page as a form. The app uses this to skip form pages when navigating back.
- `native_push_tag` requests push notification permission from the user.
- `native_review_tag` asks the app to show the App Store rating prompt when the page loads. The system throttles how often the prompt appears (and shows nothing in TestFlight builds), so it is safe to render on any page where a review would be welcome. It is automatically suppressed during App Store screenshot runs.

Signal elements are hidden `<div>` tags. Place them in the `<body>`, not the `<head>`.

### Example layout

```erb
<body>
  <%= native_tabs_tag if user_signed_in? %>
  <%= render "navbar" unless native_app? %>
  <%= yield %>
</body>
```

## Preview

`bundle exec ruby_native preview` starts a Cloudflare tunnel and displays a QR code. Your Rails server must be running separately (e.g., `bin/rails server` in another terminal). Requires `cloudflared`:

```bash
brew install cloudflare/cloudflare/cloudflared
```

Options:
- `--port 3001` to specify the local server port (defaults to 3000)

The install generator adds `.trycloudflare.com` to `config.hosts` in `development.rb` automatically. If you skipped the generator, add it manually:

```ruby
# config/environments/development.rb
config.hosts << ".trycloudflare.com"
```

The Preview app remembers the scanned URL. Long-press the app icon and tap "Switch website" to scan a new server.

## Endpoints

The gem auto-mounts at `/native`. No route configuration needed.

- `GET /native/config` returns the YAML config as JSON
- `POST /native/push/devices` registers a push notification device token
- `GET /.well-known/apple-app-site-association` returns the iOS associated-domains file when `ios.bundle_id` and `ios.team_id` are set (see Linked domains below)

## Linked domains

Tapping a link to your site opens the app instead of Safari, and saved passwords from your site autofill in the app's web views. Add your iOS identifiers to `config/ruby_native.yml`:

```yaml
ios:
  bundle_id: com.example.myapp
  team_id: ABCD123456
```

These are the same values you entered in the Ruby Native dashboard during Apple onboarding. The gem then serves `/.well-known/apple-app-site-association` and the build pipeline includes the entitlement automatically.

Apple caches the file aggressively. After the first install, changes can take up to 24 hours to propagate via Apple's CDN.

## Push notifications

Delivery uses the companion `action_push_native` gem. Ruby Native owns the registration (the `native_push_tag` helper prompts for permission, `/native/push/devices` stores the token) and defines the tap conventions on the native side.

Two destination keys are supported via `with_data`:

- `path` — internal route appended to your base URL, loaded in the WebView.
- `url` — full external URL, opened in `SFSafariViewController`.

If both are present, `url` wins. `http` and `https` open in `SFSafariViewController`; other valid schemes (`mailto:`, `tel:`, `maps:`, third-party app schemes) open via `UIApplication.open`. Malformed `url` does not fall back to `path`.

```ruby
ApplicationPushNotification
  .with_data(path: source_path(source), url: notification.external_url)
  .new(title: "New payment", body: "$49.99 from joe@example.com")
  .deliver_later_to(user.push_devices)
```

For model/migration setup, see the [action_push_native](https://github.com/basecamp/action_push_native) README.

## CLI

### Deploy from CI

Use `--if-needed` to auto-deploy only when the gem version changes:

```sh
bundle exec ruby_native deploy --if-needed
```

Set `RUBY_NATIVE_TOKEN` as an environment variable for CI (no interactive login needed):

```yaml
# GitHub Actions
- run: bundle exec ruby_native deploy --if-needed
  env:
    RUBY_NATIVE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.RUBY_NATIVE_TOKEN }}
```

### Other commands

```sh
bundle exec ruby_native login         # authenticate (opens browser)
bundle exec ruby_native deploy        # trigger a build
bundle exec ruby_native preview       # start a tunnel and display a QR code
bundle exec ruby_native logout        # remove stored credentials
```

## Common tasks

### Hide web navigation in the native app

```erb
<%= render "navbar" unless native_app? %>
```

### Show tabs only for signed-in users

```erb
<%= native_tabs_tag if user_signed_in? %>
```

### Add a native back button (Normal Mode only)

Use the `native_back_button_tag` helper. The gem's stylesheet handles showing it only when there's history to go back to. Not needed in Advanced Mode where the system provides a native back button.

```erb
<%= stylesheet_link_tag :ruby_native %>
```

```erb
<%= native_back_button_tag %>
```
